## NAME

fennel-ls - Intelligent editing features for fennel files.

## SYNOPSIS

**fennel-ls** [**-\-lint** _filename_] | [**-\-fix** _filename_] | [**-\-help**]

## DESCRIPTION

This document has information on how to configure and use fennel-ls after you
[installed it](installation.md).

## OPTIONS

**-\-lint** _filename [...filename]_
Prints diagnostics for the files given. A successful exit code
indicates no problems were found.

**fennel-ls** **-\-fix** [-y] [_filename_] [...]

Run suggested fixes from linters on files.

**-\-help** Display usage summary.

With no arguments, it waits for Language Server Protocol messages on stdin.

fennel-ls can be used with no configuration beyond connecting it to your text
editor, but if you are using external libraries you will need to add them to
the configuration to get completions, documentation, and correct diagnostics.

If a [docset is available](http://wiki.fennel-lang.org/LanguageServer) for the
library you are using:

- download it and place it in `~/.local/share/fennel-ls/docsets/`
- create a `flsproject.fnl` in the root directory of your project
- add the docset to it, it must match the name of the file you downloaded,
  without the `.lua` extension:
  ```fnl
  {:libraries {:library-name true}}
  ```

If a docset is not available, add the globals created by the library to the
`extra-globals` field, separated by spaces, so that they are not reported as
errors:

```fnl
{:extra-globals "module1 module2 function1 function2"}
```

The rest of this document provides additional details on the configuration and
usage of fennel-ls.

## CONFIGURATION

fennel-ls can be configured by creating a file named `flsproject.fnl` in the
root of your project.

The default settings are below, you only need to provide the settings you want
to change. An empty table `{}` is a valid configuration and serves as a marker
to indicate where the project root is located.

```fnl
{:fennel-path "./?.fnl;./?/init.fnl;src/?.fnl;src/?/init.fnl"
 :macro-path "./?.fnl;./?/init-macros.fnl;./?/init.fnl;src/?.fnl;src/?/init-macros.fnl;src/?/init.fnl"
 :lua-version "lua5.4"
 :libraries {}
 :extra-globals ""
 :lints {:unused-definition true
         :unknown-module-field true
         :unnecessary-method true
         :unnecessary-tset true
         :unnecessary-do true
         :redundant-do true
         :match-should-case true
         :bad-unpack true
         :var-never-set true
         :op-with-no-arguments true
         :multival-in-middle-of-call true
         :no-decreasing-comparison false}
```

- `extra-globals`: Space separated list of allowed global identifiers that will
  be added to a set of predefined lua globals.

  These identifiers and any of their fields will be considered valid and won't
  produce diagnostics. Use this when importing a library for which
  documentation is not available.

- `version`: One of `lua5.1`, `lua5.2`, `lua5.3`, `lua5.4`, `intersection`, or
  `union`.

  `intersection` represents the APIs that are available in *every* supported
  Lua version, `union` represents APIs available in *any* version.

- `libraries`: This setting controls which extra documentation fennel-ls will
  load in your environment. Each entry in the table is the name of the library
  and a boolean, `true` to enable the library.

  The name of the library is the name of a file that will be loaded from
  `~/.local/share/fennel-ls/docsets/` after appending the `.lua` extension.

  For example, if the table contains `{:love2d true}` the file `love2d.lua`
  will be loaded from `~/.local/share/fennel-ls/docsets/`.

  The available docsets are listed on the [Fennel
  wiki](http://wiki.fennel-lang.org/LanguageServer).

  See the full [docsets documentation](docsets.md) for more information on how
  to find, install, or create docsets.

  > fennel-ls respects the XDG convention, so if you changed `$XDG_DATA_HOME`
  > the files will be loaded from the location you specified.

## USAGE

Fennel-ls *cannot* tell the difference between a regular file and a macro file.
You can ask fennel-ls to **treat your file as a macro file** if the first line
exactly matches `;; fennel-ls: macro-file`. Expect this to change at some point
in the future when I come up with a better way to specify which files are meant
to be macro files.

## FEATURES

| Feature         | Locals | Fields | Builtin Globals | Across Files | Builtins | Macros | User globals |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Completions     | [X]    | [X]    | [X]             | [X]          | [X]      | [X]    | [ ]          |
| Hover           | [X]    | [X]    | [X]             | [X]          | [X]      | [X]    | [ ]          |
| Goto Definition | [X]    | [X]    | N/A             | [X]          | N/A      | [ ]    | [ ]          |
| Rename          | [X]    | [ ]    | N/A             | [ ]          | N/A      | [ ]    | [ ]          |
| Goto Reference  | [X]    | [ ]    | [ ]             | [ ]          | [ ]      | [ ]    | [ ]          |

Fennel-ls can report all fennel compiler errors, plus a few custom lints.

Unused locals will be flagged unless they begin or end with an underscore. If
you have a local that is unused in your code but necessary for pattern matching
purposes, it's recommended to put an underscore at the end. For example:

```fennel
(case [1 1 2 3 5 8]
  [a_ a_] (print "First two elements are equal"))
```
