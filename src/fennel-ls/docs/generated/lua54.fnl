 :arg {:binding "arg"
       :metadata {:fnl/docstring "Before running any code,
`lua` collects all command-line arguments
in a global table called `arg`.
The script name goes to index 0,
the first argument after the script name goes to index 1,
and so on.
Any arguments before the script name
(that is, the interpreter name plus its options)
go to negative indices.
For instance, in the call

```lua
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
```
the table is like this:

```lua
     arg = { [-2] = \"lua\", [-1] = \"-la\",
             [0] = \"b.lua\",
             [1] = \"t1\", [2] = \"t2\" }
```
If there is no script in the call,
the interpreter name goes to index 0,
followed by the other arguments.
For instance, the call

```lua
     $ lua -e \"print(arg[1])\"
```
will print `\"-e\"`.
If there is a script,
the script is called with arguments
`arg[1]`, ..., `arg[#arg]`.
Like all chunks in Lua,
the script is compiled as a variadic function."}}

It performs different functions according to its first argument, `?opt`:

* **`\"collect\"`: **
  Performs a full garbage-collection cycle.
  This is the default option.

* **`\"stop\"`: **
  Stops automatic execution of the garbage collector.
  The collector will run only when explicitly invoked,
  until a call to restart it.

* **`\"restart\"`: **
  Restarts automatic execution of the garbage collector.

* **`\"count\"`: **
  Returns the total memory in use by Lua in Kbytes.
  The value has a fractional part,
  so that it multiplied by 1024
  gives the exact number of bytes in use by Lua.

* **`\"step\"`: **
  Performs a garbage-collection step.
  The step \"size\" is controlled by `?arg`.
  With a zero value,
  the collector will perform one basic (indivisible) step.
  For non-zero values,
  the collector will perform as if that amount of memory
  (in Kbytes) had been allocated by Lua.
  Returns **true** if the step finished a collection cycle.

* **`\"isrunning\"`: **
  Returns a boolean that tells whether the collector is running
  (i.e., not stopped).

* **`\"incremental\"`: **
  Change the collector mode to incremental.
  This option can be followed by three numbers:
  the garbage-collector pause,
  the step multiplier,
  and the step size
  A zero means to not change that value.

* **`\"generational\"`: **
  Change the collector mode to generational.
  This option can be followed by two numbers:
  the garbage-collector minor multiplier
  and the major multiplier
  A zero means to not change that value.

This function should not be called by a finalizer."}}

The first one uses implicit file handles;

The second style uses explicit file handles.

When using implicit file handles,
all operations are supplied by table `io`.
When using explicit file handles,
the operation `io.open` returns a file handle
and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file handle.

The metatable for file handles provides metamethods
for `__gc` and `__close` that try
to close the file when called.

The table `io` also provides
three predefined file handles with their usual meanings from C:
`io.stdin`, `io.stdout`, and `io.stderr`.
The I/O library never closes these files.

Unless otherwise stated,
all I/O functions return **fail** on failure,
plus an error message as a second result and
a system-dependent error code as a third result,

If `chunk` is a string, the chunk is this string.
If `chunk` is a function,
`load` calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces.
Each call to `chunk` must return a string that concatenates
with previous results.
A return of an empty string, **nil**, or no value signals the end of the chunk.

If there are no syntactic errors,
`load` returns the compiled chunk as a function;
otherwise, it returns **fail** plus the error message.

When you load a main chunk,
the resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue,
the `_ENV` variable
However,
when you load a binary chunk created from a function (see `string.dump`),
the resulting function can have an arbitrary number of upvalues,
and there is no guarantee that its first upvalue will be
the `_ENV` variable.
(A non-main function may not even have an `_ENV` upvalue.)

Regardless, if the resulting function has any upvalues,
its first upvalue is set to the value of `?env`,
if that parameter is given,
or to the value of the global environment.
Other upvalues are initialized with **nil**.
All upvalues are fresh, that is,
they are not shared with any other function.

`?chunkname` is used as the name of the chunk for error messages
and debug information
When absent,
it defaults to `chunk`, if `chunk` is a string,
or to `\"=(load)\"` otherwise.

The string `?mode` controls whether the chunk can be text or binary
(that is, a precompiled chunk).
It may be the string `\"b\"` (only binary chunks),
`\"t\"` (only text chunks),
or `\"bt\"` (both binary and text).
The default is `\"bt\"`.

It is safe to load malformed binary chunks;
`load` signals an appropriate error.

Lua does not check the consistency of the code inside binary chunks;
running maliciously crafted bytecode can crash the interpreter."}}

So, `funcname` must follow the `lua_CFunction` prototype

This is a low-level function.
It completely bypasses the package and module system.
Unlike `require`,
it does not perform any path searching and

Each entry in this table is a *searcher function*.
When looking for a module,
`require` calls each of these searchers in ascending order,
with the module name (the argument given to `require`) as its
sole argument.
If the searcher finds the module,
it returns another function, the module *loader*,
plus an extra value, a *loader data*,
that will be passed to that loader and
returned as a second result by `require`.
If it cannot find the module,
it returns a string explaining why
(or **nil** if it has nothing to say).

Lua initializes this table with four searcher functions.

The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the
`package.preload` table.

The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library,
using the path stored at `package.path`.
The search is done as described in function `package.searchpath`.

The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library,
using the path given by the variable `package.cpath`.
Again,
the search is done as described in function `package.searchpath`.
For instance,
if the C path is the string

```lua
     \"./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so\"
```
the searcher for module `foo`
will try to open the files `./foo.so`, `./foo.dll`,
and `/usr/local/foo/init.so`, in that order.
Once it finds a C library,
this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the
application with the library.
Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to
be used as the loader.
The name of this C function is the string `\"luaopen_\"`
concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot
is replaced by an underscore.
Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen,
its suffix after (and including) the first hyphen is removed.
For instance, if the module name is `a.b.c-v2.1`,
the function name will be `luaopen_a_b_c`.

The fourth searcher tries an *all-in-one loader*.
It searches the C path for a library for
the root name of the given module.
For instance, when requiring `a.b.c`,
it will search for a C library for `a`.
If found, it looks into it for an open function for
the submodule;
in our example, that would be `luaopen_a_b_c`.
With this facility, a package can pack several C submodules
into one single library,
with each submodule keeping its original open function.

All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value
the file path where the module was found,
as returned by `package.searchpath`.
The first searcher always returns the string `\":preload:\"`.

Searchers should raise no errors and have no side effects in Lua.
(They may have side effects in C,
for instance by linking the application with a library.)"}}

The function starts by looking into the `package.loaded` table
to determine whether `modname` is already loaded.
If it is, then `require` returns the value stored
at `package.loaded[modname]`.
(The absence of a second result in this case
signals that this call did not have to load the module.)
Otherwise, it tries to find a *loader* for the module.

To find a loader,
`require` is guided by the table `package.searchers`.
Each item in this table is a search function,
that searches for the module in a particular way.
By changing this table,
we can change how `require` looks for a module.
The following explanation is based on the default configuration
for `package.searchers`.

First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`.
If it has a value,
this value (which must be a function) is the loader.
Otherwise `require` searches for a Lua loader using the
path stored in `package.path`.
If that also fails, it searches for a C loader using the
path stored in `package.cpath`.
If that also fails,
it tries an *all-in-one* loader (see `package.searchers`).

Once a loader is found,
`require` calls the loader with two arguments:
`modname` and an extra value,
a *loader data*,
also returned by the searcher.
The loader data can be any value useful to the module;
for the default searchers,
it indicates where the loader was found.
(For instance, if the loader came from a file,
this extra value is the file path.)
If the loader returns any non-nil value,
`require` assigns the returned value to `package.loaded[modname]`.
If the loader does not return a non-nil value and
has not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`,
then `require` assigns **true** to this entry.
In any case, `require` returns the
final value of `package.loaded[modname]`.
Besides that value, `require` also returns as a second result
the loader data returned by the searcher,
which indicates how `require` found the module.

If there is any error loading or running the module,
or if it cannot find any loader for the module,
then `require` raises an error."}}

`F`, `n`, `*`, `h`, `L`, and `l` are not supported

Both width and precision, when present,

The specifier `q` formats booleans, nil, numbers, and strings
in a way that the result is a valid constant in Lua source code.
Booleans and nil are written in the obvious way
(`true`, `false`, `nil`).
Floats are written in hexadecimal,
to preserve full precision.
A string is written between double quotes,
using escape sequences when necessary to ensure that
it can safely be read back by the Lua interpreter.
For instance, the call

```lua
     string.format('%q', 'a string with \"quotes\" and \\n new line')
```
may produce the string:

```lua
     \"a string with \\\"quotes\\\" and \\
      new line\"

This specifier does not support modifiers (flags, width, precision).

The conversion specifiers
`A`, `a`, `E`, `e`, `f`,
`G`, and `g` all expect a number as argument.
The specifiers `c`, `d`,
`i`, `o`, `u`, `X`, and `x`
expect an integer.
When Lua is compiled with a C89 compiler,
the specifiers `A` and `a` (hexadecimal floats)
do not support modifiers.

The specifier `s` expects a string;
if its argument is not a string,
it is converted to one following the same rules of `tostring`.
If the specifier has any modifier,
the corresponding string argument should not contain embedded zeros.

The specifier `p` formats the pointer
returned by `lua_topointer`.
That gives a unique string identifier for tables, userdata,
threads, strings, and functions.
For other values (numbers, nil, booleans),
this specifier results in a string representing
the pointer `NULL`."}}

in which all (or the first `?n`, if given)
occurrences of the `pattern`have been
replaced by a replacement string specified by `repl`,
which can be a string, a table, or a function.
`gsub` also returns, as its second value,
the total number of matches that occurred.
The name `gsub` comes from *Global SUBstitution*.

If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement.
The character `%` works as an escape character:
any sequence in `repl` of the form `%*d*`,
with *d* between 1 and 9,
stands for the value of the *d*-th captured substring;
the sequence `%0` stands for the whole match;
the sequence `%%` stands for a single `%`.

If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match,
using the first capture as the key.

If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a
match occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments,
in order.

In any case,
if the pattern specifies no captures,
then it behaves as if the whole pattern was inside a capture.

If the value returned by the table query or by the function call
is a string or a number,
then it is used as the replacement string;
otherwise, if it is **false** or **nil**,
then there is no replacement
(that is, the original match is kept in the string).

Here are some examples:

```lua
     x = string.gsub(\"hello world\", \"(%w+)\", \"%1 %1\")
     --> x=\"hello hello world world\"
     
     x = string.gsub(\"hello world\", \"%w+\", \"%0 %0\", 1)
     --> x=\"hello hello world\"
     
     x = string.gsub(\"hello world from Lua\", \"(%w+)%s*(%w+)\", \"%2 %1\")
